        Okay so for now we have only one cell so let's go ahead and grab this and copy it, so we at least have two cells to take a look at in the browser. Let's save that, and let's go to the browser. And, here we are. So, we see that we have our picture here. Picture with what looks like an egg roll. With to the right of it, we have our title of the menu and some lorem ipsum text that's going to be a description with, it's not really styled yet. This D01 is sitting all the way here, Instead of down here and this is not styled 100% either. So let's go back to the code editor and give it some styles. First of all, let's give the second cell instead of d1, let's give it a d2 so we can understand the difference between the two. Let's go open our styles.css and I already have some pre-made styles that I prepared before the lecture. So let's go ahead and copy and paste them right under our menu category styles. Let's go find them real quick. They should be under home, menu categories, page. And here it is so let's go ahead and paste it right here and what we're going to do is we're going to comment them out so we'll go one by one and explain them a little bit better that way. Let's comment them out right here and the first thing we want to do is the menu item tile.

        So the menu item tile is this one right here its that single cell grid, in other words that's this whole thing that is this single cell grid right here. So what we're doing here is I want the margin bottom to be 25 pixels, so basically what we're doing is we're saying I want to separate this a little bit from the next row even though it's not a technically bootstrap grid row it's going to be a next row just because some of the items or a lot of these items are going to start spilling over to the next line and there is going to be two of them per line. Okay. This hr here, the item tile hr, should only show up when we're squeezing the browser past, I believe the small, when it gets to be extra small. So let's save it and take a look at our browser and let's see what's going on here. Let's squeeze the browser a little bit and see if that hr shows up. And when we get to super small, the chart there shows up to visually separate the first item from the second item and so on. So let's go ahead and stretch it back out and go back to our code editor and let's style the pressing here. Let's remove this down the line right here.

        In fact that's actually those are two pricing type of styles so let's style them together, okay so the first thing we're doing is the menu item tile that is followed by menu item price. So the menu item price that is sitting inside of the element with a class name menu a new item tile, let's go take a look at the HTML of that. So the menu item tile is right here and the menu item price is right there. So basically, we're targeting this thing right here, this dip where the prices are. So let's go back to styles.css. And what we're doing is we're increasing it's font a little bit. Aligning it to the right because we wanted to align to the right over here, to the right of this picture. So we're aligning it to the right. And we're giving it a margin top negative 15. And a margin right of negative 15, so that is probably something that you will proba
